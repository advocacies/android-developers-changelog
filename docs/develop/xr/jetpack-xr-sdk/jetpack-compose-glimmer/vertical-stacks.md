In Jetpack Compose Glimmer, the [`VerticalStack`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/stack/VerticalStack.composable) is a lazy, vertically
scrollable layout that arranges items in a visually overlapping,
three-dimensional sequence. The primary item is prominently displayed in the
foreground, while subsequent items are positioned behind it.

## Scrolling and positioning behaviors

Because stacks keep items arranged in a compact, overlapping layout, they have
some behaviors that are different from other types of sequenced components, such
as [lists](/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer/lists):

* As a user scrolls vertically, the active foreground item transitions out of
  view, allowing the item immediately beneath it to slide into the prominent
  foreground position.
* Items always snap-animate using a specialized spring animation into the
  foreground position after a user's gesture ends.
* Items are positioned along the z-axis, with items further in the list placed
  behind the primary item.

## Focus management

The `VerticalStack` uses a specialized focus system to ensure that the current
foreground item is always the primary target for user interaction:

* **Initial focus and re-entry**: Initial focus and focus re-entry goes to the
  current top item of the stack.
* **Auto-focus notification**: As items transition, the stack requests focus
  for the top item.
* **Focus tracking**: Each item uses `onFocusChanged` to notify the
  `StackState` of its individual focus status.

## Example: Create a vertical stack

The following code creates a vertical stack with several items:

```
@Composable
fun VerticalStackSample() {
    VerticalStack(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().height(364.dp)) {
        item(key = 0) {
            Card(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().itemDecoration(CardDefaults.shape)) {
                Text(
                    "Item-0",
                    style = LocalTextStyle.current.copy(textMotion = TextMotion.Animated),
                )
            }
        }
        items(count = 10, key = { it + 1 }) { index ->
            Card(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().itemDecoration(CardDefaults.shape)) {
                Text(
                    "Item-${index + 1}",
                    style = LocalTextStyle.current.copy(textMotion = TextMotion.Animated),
                )
            }
        }
    }
}

### Key points about the code

* Sets [`textMotion`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/text/TextStyle#textMotion()) for the text's [`LocalTextStyle`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/package-summary#LocalTextStyle()) to
  [`Animated`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/text/style/TextMotion#Animated()). This promotes smooth text rendering during layout
  animations or scaling transitions to preventing pixel-snapping artifacts.
* Provides a specific size of `364.dp` for the height of the vertical stack.
  Always provide a specific height, use a height modifier, or apply the
  [`fillMaxSize`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/fillMaxSize.modifier) modifier to define the visual area for card transitions.
* Unlike other components that take a shape parameter directly,
  `VerticalStack` manages the visual boundaries of its items using the
  [`itemDecoration`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/stack/StackItemScope#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).itemDecoration(androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Shape)) modifier. This example passes the same shape for the
  initial item's `itemDecoration` as all the child items to maintain
  consistent clipping and visual effects. This example uses the default
  [`CardDefaults.shape`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/CardDefaults#shape()).
