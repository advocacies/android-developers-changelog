# Use AI-powered analysis features Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





Android Performance Analyzer includes features to support AI-assisted analysis of system traces.
This guide explains how to use these features with your preferred AI agent to
streamline the analysis process.

## Explore a trace with your AI agent

With the sheer breadth of data available in an Android Performance Analyzer trace file, it can
be difficult to know where to start if you aren't already experienced with
profiling. The System Profiler supports a purpose-built analysis skill that
works with your preferred AI agent to suggest starting points in response to
high-level questions.

To get started, download and install the
[perfetto-trace-analysis](https://github.com/android/skills/tree/main/profilers/perfetto-trace-analysis) skill from the Android skills GitHub
repository. You can do this with [Android CLI](/tools/agents/android-cli) by running the
following command:

```
android skills add perfetto-trace-analysis
```

## Use AI to build custom queries

Android Performance Analyzer supports [custom SQL queries](/android-performance-analyzer/view#custom-queries) for deeper and more
flexible analysis of your recorded traces. You can always write your own
queries, but the System Profiler also supports letting your preferred AI agent
write a query for you.
